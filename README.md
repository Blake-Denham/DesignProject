/app is a node.js server runnning an express app linked to a local mongoDB database. This was the orginal idea I had for the app, but I decided to go with AWS instead.

/main.py is a small script used to generate visualized plots used in the report.
the data comes from running the code here on open source data https://github.com/ChullEPG/Bumpy-Ride
